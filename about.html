        <p>Hi, I am co-founder of DepositBee, Liam. My co-founder Ben and I started DepositBee because as recent graduates we have seen too many people getting scammed by their landlords and taking too much deposit.</p>
        <p>Students are too worried about how time consuming the whole process of getting their deposit back can be, as well as fearing being the 'little guy' in a legal battle. We are here to stand up for them and get them back what they are entitled to.</p>
        <p>We are aware that the majority of universities or unions will have things such as 'advice centres', but the research we have done states that these are not doing enough to help students. The main problem is the issue of awareness at the start of the year of all the things students should do in order to ensure they have the best chance possible of getting back a fair amount. Our app in itself generates that awareness. It makes students collate all the potentially necessary evidence - including contracts, photos, inventories etc. - and therefore lets them know of everything they should be doing, not only at university, but in the future too.</p>
